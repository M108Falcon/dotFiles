# Kitty: A Fast terminal emulator with Ligatures n Much more
[Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) is a GPU accelerated terminal emulator that support Font Ligatures, UniCode characters and Emojis extremely well(Follow the link to view the project).  
Although you get the config file for kitty when you install it, but if you're feeling lazy, just copy mine!  
I have not deleted the contents of the file that might come hady in case you wanna change the settings but I have made many quality of life changes to it already.  
**Keep in mind:**
### You need [NerdFonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) for the ligatures and glyphs to render correctly. 
I have [FiraCode Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode) installed in my system and set as Defualt in the configs too.
