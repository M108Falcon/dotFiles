# Alacritty: The minimalist GPU accelerated terminal emulator 
The YAML file can be easily pulled from [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)'s github page. I've edited the most of it and added custom keybinds and colorscheme as well as made few tweaks to make it truly minimalist terminal emulator.
