# Instructions for Windows Users
## Make sure all the contents in the checklist are enabled/installed in your system
- [ ] [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) isntallled and added to PATH
- [ ] [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/) installed and added to PATH
- [ ] [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) >= v10.12 installed and added to PATH
- [ ] [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#alternatives-stable) installed globally(any way is fine although *I'd recommend through npm as it'll automatically make it available in PATH*) and added to PATH
- [ ] Patched [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) installed to make sure all the glyphs render correctly.
- [ ] Vim Plugin Manager: [Vim Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) installed into ~\AppData\Local\nvim\autoload\ directory
- [ ] init.vim file present in ~\AppData\Local\nvim\ directory

Complete the above checklist before installing and enabling Vim Plugins and you would ***hopefully*** not run into any problems.

#### To extract full potential out of your NeoVim experience, I'd recommned all the language compilers/interpreters that you're using added to PATH.
