# nvimConfigs
My config files for NeoVim  
**Note**:   
Install vim plugin manager [Vim Plugged](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to ensure plugins and settings work properly.  
Install [NerdFonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)  to enable proper rendering of Glyphs.  
You need to have Nodejs >= v10.12 installed for [Coc Extension](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) to work correctly.
